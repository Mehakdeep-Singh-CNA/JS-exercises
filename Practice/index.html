<!-- You are building a simple web application that requires the user to enter their age and displays a message 
based on their age group. Use a for loop and an array to create a function that takes 
the user's age and returns a message based on the following conditions:

If the user's age is less than 18, display "You are a minor"
If the user's age is between 18 and 65 (inclusive), display "You are an adult"
If the user's age is greater than 65, display "You are a senior citizen"
Use a for loop to iterate over the array of age groups and return the appropriate message.
 Use the following starter code: -->

 <!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>Age Message</title>
</head>
<body>
	<h1>Enter Your Age</h1>
	<form>
		<label for="age">Age:</label>
		<input type="number" id="age" name="age">
		<input type="button" value="Submit" onclick="displayMessage()">
	</form>

	<p id="message"></p>

	<script>
		function displayMessage() {
            const age =  parseInt(document.getElementById('age').value);
            let ageArray = ["minor", "adult", "senior citizen"]
            let finalString = "";

            for(let i = 0; i< ageArray.length; i++){
                if(i == 0 && (age < 18)){
                    finalString = `You are a ${ageArray[i]}`
                }else if(i == 1 && (age >18 && age < 65)){
                    finalString = `You are a ${ageArray[i]}`
                }else if(i == 2 && ( age > 65)) {
                    finalString = `You are a ${ageArray[i]}`
                }
                document.getElementById('message').textContent = finalString
            }
		}
	</script>
</body>
</html>
